Robots with feelings: giving feelings to artificial beings could mean so much more to human-machine interaction. As robots tend to become more and more human-like 
physically, it can get scary and sometimes problematic to give them the one trait that distinguishes humans: feelings and the ability to show emotion. 
Though they could show social skills and communication, the question of to what extent could they be human-like emotionally? There could be a list of emotions 
that robots could imitate or 'feel', but there are limitations to how and what they could do I think. 
To what extent will human uniqueness be taken over? I can imagine myself having a nice conversation with a robot, but at some point I would want to leave
and crave human interaction.
