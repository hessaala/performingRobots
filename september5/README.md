Patently, physical performing agents could be much more audience engaging and entertaining. However, the challenge of developing autonomous robots lies in managing the extent in which the puppotics could interact with and be understood from the audience. The trade-off between having virtual, screen-based characters versus puppotics would be on how clear the interactions would be between the robots and audience. Specially when there is a group communication between the robots, the messages they intend to speak to may very easily be off-targeted and the plot may be misunderstood. I think the most important interaction that could control this confusion is the director â€“ agent communication and the specifics should be rehearsed very well. Implementing the RoboWoggles was merely an ideal example of puppotics and how they work, thus for future more complex puppotics projects, the communication problems mentioned above are to be addressed.
