Constructing our robot physically and to portray an emotion was very fun to work on. Our robot's emotion was panic and fear and we represented that with quick 
backward, forward and side movements of different speeds. After screwing the wheels, battery, and arduino to the board, we attached cardboards to add height and
physical character to it. The challenging part was to keep its body from falling down with its movement since the movement is fast and has harsh pauses.
