Robots as actors or objects/tool: the distinction between them is significant. Actors have free will; they do what they want with the different choices they make. Tools are just objects that are used to drive the plot forward, they arenâ€™t conscious. The difference lies in the personal touch they give, which actors encounter. 
Different elements of a play (objects) could be thought of as dramaturgical agents, like lighting. Do they have their own character role in a play or are they simply agents? Is there a need to think about these objects as actors? 
This conversation extends to robots, is a robot used to direct the plot or is it part of the main characters? I think the answer depends on the role of the robot in the scene, what do they act as in the performative environment? And the same answer goes for lighting and other elements of dramaturgy. 
The dematerialization of the object in art gives rise to questions of how it connotes meaning in the space of the performance for both the creators and the audience. I think part of that meaning is influenced by how accessible robots are. How do we make robots inclusive to everyone? To those financially, physically unable?
