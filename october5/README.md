The definition of the freudian robot was not precisely stated and was defined as something very broad that could be interpreted by people in different ways. Are we part
of this very open definition, or is it just the intelligent machines we construct and operate? Maybe we are not part of this now but we will be in the future. If it 
were to happen, it would be part of the discussion of human robot interaction and how this would develop later on. It depends on the role of robots and machines in our 
lives, will they be replacing us or will we coexist? Would they be taking over our jobs, or will we just use them as extensions to ourselves? If they would be more than 
what they are now, then what would be the difference between us and robots? Our thinking, inner monologue, mindset? We would then fall into the same category of fredian
robots in my opinion because our minds would operate similarily, either them more human or us more robotic. All those are open questions that only time will tell.
