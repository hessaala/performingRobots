Main ideas: 
-	Development of action coordination in robotics
-	Using performance robotics as testing ground and implementation platform 
-	The most important aspects of human robot interaction: timing effects, coordination, robot appearance on humans, action fluency. 
-	Research on stage performance robots to develop methods
-	HRI research with stage performance: dialog, sensory processing, action selection, action timing 
-	Constrained: by script, by score, by set design = limiting perception and expectations of a robotic system
-	But also provides a rich environment for a robot to combine actions with a human partner because performances include verbal and non-verbal behavior and the audiences are sensitive to the main aspects of HRI
-	Timing: anticipatory action at sub-action resolution = more fluent, more committed, and more contributing to the team VS robots that are purely reactive
Questions: 
-	What other factors would help in better HRI? The article mentioned the robots having an “inner monologue” to maintain continuity and realism in their behavior, whether they say something or not, resulting in a more natural interaction. Predictability using facial expressions, sensing what they’ll say or do based on 
-	Other than performative arts as the article suggests, what would we turn to, to experiment fluent coordination and joint action timing of HRI? -medical settings (enhanced sensing), chatbots (friend), psychologist, manufacturing industry
-	What are some of the challenges HRI might face that theatre performance overlooks? Response to human touch, safety in safety-critical situations. As robots are introduced, issues of trust and accountability come to the fore as well as how they fit into organizational structures. If robots have too little autonomy, human operators will waste time attending to robots instead of attending to their work tasks. If robots are highly autonomous, situational awareness is diminished. A balance needs to be struck to find a level of autonomy suitable for the task, the realistic capabilities of the automation, and the need to actively engage human operators in a constructive fashion. 
-	We talk about giving robots good timing, responsiveness, continuity, an inner monologue, and intuitive responsiveness, all making it seem very real and human-like, how possible is it for robots to think like humans?
