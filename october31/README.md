Eight Lessons Learned about Non-verbal Interactions through Robot Theater
-	The study of robot theatre through interactions beyond words, whether the purpose solely for entertainment or social 
-	For the development of more effective human robot interaction, the sociability of robots should be studied in the domain of communications through face, bodily expression and other channel functions or psychology 
Lessons: 
1.	Goal defined with intention 
-	Timing effects plays a role to indicate motivation
-	Using movement profiles rather than imitated gestures 
-	Interpretation of robot gestural expressions is easy 

2.	Consciousness in the physical appearance 
-	There are unique attributes of embodiment and physical presence 
-	Behavior precedes feeling 
-	Physicality improves expression

3.	Re-mapping robot behaviors on to ourselves 
-	Robot actions are simulated through our physical capabilities 
-	We tend to have expressions that are so complex that robots cannot fully imitate or ‘feel’

4.	Outward communication > Internal state
-	Our interaction with robots is affected by how we perceive a robot’s expression, regardless of its true internal state
-	External communication outweighs internal feelings of the robot 
-	Physical design could streamline the communication of robot intention

5.	What defines the social role of a robot: character or prop?
-	Genuine interaction distinguishes between those roles
-	There is a difference in reactions depending on how we perceive the social role of a robot

6.	Interaction intelligence in acting 
-	How do we judge a good actor? Do we have the same criteria for human-robot performances? 
-	Do humans compensate for robots’ mistakes? Can the contrary occur? 

7.	Audience real-time feedback on social behaviors
-	Acknowledgement of audience’s response to incorporate them within the performance 

8.	Humor is related to likeability 
-	I think humor is very subjective, so as long as the boundaries of the robot’s humor is limited to not offend, keeping it appropriate to the subject, reasonable, logical and within context, it is tolerable. Rather, if it is within those limits and of course is funny, indeed it does make the performance much more interactive and engaging with the audience.
